## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- Instead of using a display flex, use a display grid that can control the container and would not make it static.
- I have learned a useful technique such as using the root.

```
:root {
    --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --light-pink: hsl(275, 100%, 97%);
    --grayish-purple: hsl(292, 16%, 49%);
    --dark-purple: hsl(292, 42%, 14%);
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJuD66J7uCE&ab_channel=edsHTML*/) - This video is the reason why I managed to finish the project.
  I have learned so much about it despite being such a simple project.
